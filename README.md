To unravel the fundamental mechanisms of lung adenocarcinoma, 
a feasible framework was developed to explore the formation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma.
We model the equilibrium process based on time-invariant gene regulatory network, 
and "fmin_mean.m" and "fmian_sigma_draw_phenotypic_Landscape.m" is the approximation of phenotypic landscape based on constrained nonlinear optimization problem.
And we model the nonequilibrium process based on time-invariant gene regulatory network, 
and "fmin_mean.m" and "fmian_sigma_draw_phenotypic_Landscape.m" is the approximation of phenotypic landscape based on constrained nonlinear optimization problem.
